# Navigating State Management in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose

I recently faced a challenge in state management while implementing a feature to generate OTPs in a project using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Initially, when users generated an OTP and navigated to another screen, returning would show the previous response instead of the expected behavior.

To address this, I restructured my ViewModel to maintain a persistent state for the OTP response and added a method to clear it when necessary. This helped improve the user experience significantly.

I'm curious to hear from the community:

- How do you handle state management in your Kotlin projects?
- What approaches have you found most effective?
- Are there best practices you swear by for ensuring a smooth user experience in Jetpack Compose?

# ViewModel
```kotlin
@HiltViewModel
class MainViewModel @Inject constructor() : ViewModel() {
    var isLoading by mutableStateOf(false)

    var verifyOtpResponse by mutableStateOf<Boolean?>(null)
        private set
    fun verifyOTP() = viewModelScope.launch {
        isLoading = true
        delay(3000)
        isLoading = false
        verifyOtpResponse = true
    }
}
```

# Screen
```kotlin
val verifyOtpResponse = viewModel.verifyOtpResponse

    LaunchedEffect(verifyOtpResponse) {
        verifyOtpResponse?.let {
            Toast.makeText(context, "OTP Verified Successfully!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            if(it) {
                delay(300)
                navController.navigate(Routes.SecondScreen)
            }
        }
    }
```
